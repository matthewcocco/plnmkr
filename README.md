# courseplanner / planmaker

primitive UI prototype demo for degree-plan-making interface component of courseplanner.

to use, go to http://matthewcocco.com/plnmkr or serve the root of this repo with your favorite solution.

hacked together with the help of the [foundation framework][foundation] (prestyled html) & [fusejs][fusejs] library (fuzzy search done right)

built in a group project partnership with (Connor Irvine, Conrad Irving), Jens Stamenov, Jacob Woolf as part of ITSS 4380.501.17s @ UT Dallas

the feverish 'kludge' commits for the demo as things stopped working (or more likely, as bugs were fixed and unintended but correct behavior came about) are something I regret but were necessary to present. I miss the enter-to-add-course interaction but had to scrap it for the awful button so we wouldn't repeatedly navigate to the same page over and over again.

TODO: revisit this idea but with proper web components instead of just javascript and the "caching magic" of preformatted json
